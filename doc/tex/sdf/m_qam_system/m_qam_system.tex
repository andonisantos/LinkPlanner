The goal of this project is to simulate a Quadrature Amplitude Modulation transmission system with M points in the constellation diagram (M-QAM) and to perform a Bit Error Rate (BER) measurement that can be compared with theoretical values. 

M-QAM systems can encode $\log_2 M$ bits per symbol which means they can transmit higher data rates keeping the same bandwidth when compared, for example, to PSK systems. However, because the states are closer together, these systems can be more susceptible to noise.

The Bit Error Rate (BER) is a measurement of how a bit stream is altered by a transmission system due to noise (among other factors). To study this effect we introduced Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to model thermal noise ate the receiver. 

For $M=4$ the M-QAM system reduces to a Quadrature Phase Shift Keying system (QPSK) system that uses four equispaced points in the constellation diagram (see figure \ref{fig:const}).

%M can take several values: $2, 4, 16, 32, ...$. The first two correspond to BPSK and QPSK modulation, respectively.

\subsection{Theoretical Analysis }

M-QAM is a modulation scheme that takes advantage of two carriers (usually sinusoidal waves) with a phase difference of $\frac{\pi}{2}$. The resultant output consists of a signal with both amplitude and phase variations. The two carriers, refered to as I (In-phase) and Q (Quadrature), can be represented as 

\begin{align}
	I=A\cos(\phi) \\
	Q=A\sin(\phi)
\end{align}
which means that any sinusoidal wave can be decomposed in its I and Q components:

\begin{align}
	A\cos(\omega~t+\phi)&=A\left(\cos(\omega~t)\cos(\phi)-\sin(\omega~t)\sin(\phi)\right) \\
	&=I\cos(\omega~t)-Q\sin(\omega~t),
\end{align} 
where we have used the expression for the cossine of a sum and the definitions of I and Q.

%When demodulating a signal it is necessary to associate the received signal to the corresponding signal. The existence of noise in the channel means that we can only compute the probability that a given signal corresponds to a certain carrier and that's why we need to define the BER. Using
%
%\begin{equation}
%P_i f(s|c_i)>P_j f(s|c_j), \qquad i\neq j
%\end{equation}
%where $f(s|c_i)$ stands for the probability of detecting the signal $s$ given that $c_i$ was emmited. This inequallity can be rewritten in the following way
%
%\begin{equation}
%P(c_i|s)>P(c_j|s)
%\end{equation}
%where $P(c_i|s)$ and $P(c_j|s)$ are called \textit{a posteriori} probabilities and represent the probability that $c_i$ or $c_j$ were transmitted given that $s$ was received. In terms of the systems this simply means that we should select the signal most likely to have been transmitted.
%
%In the case of additive white gaussian noise the $f$ function is simply given by
%
%\begin{equation}
%f(s|c_i)=\frac{e^{-x^2/n_0}}{(\pi n_0)^{N/2}}
%\end{equation}
%where $x$ is the Euclidean distance in the I-Q plane between the signal received and carrier i and $N$ is the number of noise samples.
%
%When using 4-QAM modulation all points are at an equal distance from the origin (in the I-Q plane) so they all have the same energy given by
%
%\begin{equation}
%E=\frac{d^2}{2}
%\end{equation}
%where $d$ is the side of the square formed bye the constellation points.
%
%The probability that a given signal is identified correctly is given by
%
%\begin{equation}
%P_c=r^2
%\end{equation}
%where $n_0/2$ is the noise variance for AWGN and
%
%\begin{equation}
%r=\int_{-d/2}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-x^2/n_0}}{\sqrt{\pi n_0}} dx.
%\end{equation}
%
%The error probability, $P_e$, given by $1-P_c$ is given by
%
%\begin{equation}
%P_e=\erfc \sqrt{\frac{E}{2 n_0}}.
%\end{equation}

The probability of symbol error, $P_s$, in coherent M-PSK demodulation with AWGN is given by 

\begin{equation}
	P_s=2~Q\left(\sqrt{2~\log_2 M \left(\frac{E_b}{n_0}\right)\sin^2\frac{\pi}{M}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $E_b$ is the energy of one bit, $n_0$ is the noise power and the function $Q$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
	Q(x)=\frac{1}{2} erfc\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
	\label{eq:Ps}
\end{equation}

The probability of bit errors, $P_b$ is related to $P_s$ by
\begin{equation}
	P_b=\frac{1}{\log_2 M}P_s.
	\label{eq:Pb}
\end{equation} 

For QPSK we get, using $M=4$ in equations \ref{eq:Ps} and \ref{eq:Pb},
\begin{equation}
	P_b=\frac{1}{2} erfc\left(\sqrt{\frac{2~E_b}{n_0}}\right).
\end{equation}

This function is plotted in figure \ref{fig:QPSK_th_curve} for $n_0=10^{-6}$.

\end{figure}

The M-QAM transmission system is a complex block of code that simulates the modulation, transmission and
demodulation of an optical signal using M-QAM modulation.
It is composed of four blocks: a transmitter, a receiver, a sink and a block that performs a Bit Error Rate (BER) measurement. The schematic representation of the
system is presented in figure \ref{MQAM_system_block_diagram}. 

\paragraph{Current state:} The system currently being implement is a QPSK system (M=4).

\paragraph{Future work:} Extend this block to include other values of M.

\subsection*{Functional description}

A complete description of the M-QAM transmitter and M-QAM homodyne receiver blocks can be found in the \textit{Library} chapter of this document as well as a detailed description of the independent blocks that compose these blocks.

The M-QAM transmitter generates one or two optical signals by enconding a binary string using M-QAM modulation. It also outputs a binary signal that is used to perform the BER measurement.

The M-QAM homodyne receiver accepts one input optical signal and outputs
a binary signal. It performs the M-QAM demodulation of the input signal by combining the optical signal with a local oscillator.

The demodulated optical signal is compared to the one produced by the transmitter in order to estimate the Bit Error Rate (BER).

The files corresponding to each of the system's blocks are summarized in table \ref{files_table}. Along with the library and corresponding source files these allow for the full operation of the M-QAM system.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis}

In this section we show the simulation results and compared them with the theoretical predictions. Figures \ref{fig:ber_pseudorandom} shows the variation of the BER with the power of the signal, using $4000$ bits and a pseudorandom binary sequence with pattern length $2^7$. To produce this plots we considered a noise amplitude of $10^{-6}$ and an amplification of $10^3$.
