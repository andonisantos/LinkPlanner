Quantum noise is an intrinsic property of light, a manifestation of the vaccum field fluctuations
\cite{fox2006}.
%\footnote{Mark Fox, p.132}
Contrarily to the majority of noise sources, that are overcomed by better equipment, quantum noise has a lower bound, given by the Heisenberg uncertanty principle, which cannot be broken. This propertie can be useful in some areas, such in quantum cryptography, were many protocols depend on it to ensure their security.\\
The objective of this work is to develop a numerical model for the quantum noise in a double homodyne detection and to validate the numerical model with experimental results.\\

%EFEITO FOTO-ELECTRICO\\
The photocurrent $i(t)$ is proportional to the number of photons incident in the detector, given by optical power $P$ divided by the photon energy unit $\hbar \omega$. The eficiency coefficient $\eta$ represents the probability of an incident photon removing an electron from it's atom and $e$ is simply the unit of charge.\\

Given the photo-electric effect, where each photon of a given energy will remove a electron at a certain energy level???? (and assuming perfect efficiency) we can obtain the current, which is the quantity of charge per unit of time, given by the number of electrons per second times the charge per electron. To obtain the number of electrons per time unit, we just obtain the number of photons per second, given by the power of the light beam divides per unit of energy of a photon.???\\ SIMPLIFICAR e MODULAR.\\

{\bf Thorlabs detector}
The detector used in the laboraty is the Thorlabs PDB 450C. This detector consists of two well-matched photodiodes and a transimpedance amplifier that generates an output voltage (RF OUTPUT) proportional to the difference between the photocurrents of the photodiodes.\\
Additionally, the unit has two monitor outputs(MONITOR+ and MONITOR-) to observe the optical input power level on each photodiode separately.

We start by defining number states $\ket{n}$ (or Fock states), which correspond to states with perfectly fixed number of photons
%\footnote{Loundon, p.184}
\cite{loudon2000}.
Associated to those states are two operators, the creation $\hat{a}^\dagger$ and annihilation $\hat{a}$ operators, which in a simple way, remove or add one photon from a given number state
%\footnote{Mark Fox, p.155}
\cite{fox2006}.
Their action is defined as
%
\begin{center}
	\hspace{-4mm}
	\begin{minipage}{44mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\hat{a} \ket{n} = \sqrt{n} \ket{n-1}
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
	$,\quad$
	\begin{minipage}{52mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\hat{a}^\dagger \ket{n} = \sqrt{n+1} \ket{n+1}
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
	$,\quad$
	\begin{minipage}{35mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\hat{n} \ket{n} = n \ket{n}
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%
in which $\hat{n} = \hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}$ is the number operator. Therefore, number states are eigenvectors of the number operator.\\
\\
Coherent states have properties that closely resemble classical electromagnetic waves, and are generated by single-mode lasers well above the threshold.
\cite{loudon2000}
%\footnote{Loudon, p.190}
We can defined them, using number states in the following manner
\begin{equation}
\ket{\alpha} = e^{-\frac{|\alpha|^2}{2}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\alpha^n}{\sqrt{n!}} \ket{n}
\end{equation}
in which the complex number $\alpha$ is the sole parameter that characterizes it.
%\footnote{Loudon, p.184}
%\footnote{Loudon, p.186}
In fact, if we calculate the expected number of photons with $\bra{\alpha} \hat{n} \ket{\alpha}$ we will obtain $|\alpha|^2$. The coherent state is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator, $\hat{a}\ket{\alpha} = \alpha \ket{\alpha}$.\\
\\
%
%
Using the creation and annihilation operators, we can define two quadrature operators
\cite{loudon2000}
%\footnote{Loudon, p.138, (4.3.36)}
%
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{41mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\hat{X} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \hat{a}^\dagger + \hat{a} \right)
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
	$,\quad$
	\begin{minipage}{40mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\hat{Y} = \frac{i}{2} \left( \hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a} \right)
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%
The expected value of these two operators, using a coherent state $\ket{\alpha}$ are
%
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{37mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\braket{\hat{X}} = \textrm{Re}(\alpha)
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
	$,\quad$
	\begin{minipage}{37mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\braket{\hat{Y}} = \textrm{Im}(\alpha)
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%
We see that the expected value of these operators give us the real and imaginary part of $\alpha$. Now, we can obtain the uncertainty of these operators, using:
%
\begin{equation}
\textrm{Var}(\hat{X}) = \braket{\hat{X}^2} - \braket{\hat{X}}^2
\end{equation}
%
For each of these quadrature operators the variance will be
%
\begin{equation}
\textrm{Var}(\hat{X}) = \textrm{Var}(\hat{Y}) = \frac{1}{4}
\end{equation}
%
This result show us that for both quadratures, the variance of measurement is the same and independent of the value of $\alpha$.
%
%

\subsubsection{Homodyne detection}

The measurent of a quadrature of an input signal (S) is made by using the balanced homodyne detection technique, which measures the phase difference between the input signal and a local oscillator (LO). The measurement of quadrature are made relative to a reference phase of the LO, such that if the measurement is made in-phase with this reference, the value will be proportional to the $\hat{X}$ quadrature of the signal. If the phase of the LO is has an offset of $\pi/2$ relative to the reference, the output will be proportional to the $\hat{Y}$ quadrature of the signal.\\
\\
Experimentally, the balanced homodyne detection requires a local oscillator with the same frequency as the input signal, but with a much larger amplitude. These two signals are combined using a 50:50 beam splitter, from were two beams emerge, which are then converted to currents using photodides. Finally, the two currents are subtracted, resulting in an output current proportional to a quadrature of the input signal
\cite{fox2006}.\\

A phase of the local oscillator can be defined as the reference phase. A phase offset equal to $0$ or $\pi/2$ will give an output proportional to the signal's in-phase component or to the quadrature component, respectively. Therefore, the $\hat{X}$ operator will correspond to the in-phase component and $\hat{Y}$ operator correspond to quadrature component

In the lab and in our simulations, a more complex system is used, the double balanced homodyne detection, which allows the simultaneous measurement of the $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Y}$ components. The signal is divided in two beam with half the power of the original. One of the beams is used in a balanced homodyne detection with a local oscillator. The other beam is used in another balanced homodyne detection, but using a local oscillator with a phase difference $\pi/2$ relative to the first one.

\subsubsection{Noise sources in homodyne detection}
The detection of light using photodiodes is subjected to various sources of noise. One of these sources is the electrical field itself. The interaction of the signal with the vaccuum field adds quantum noise to the detection.
Another source of noise comes from the detection system, such as photodiodes and other electrical circuits, originating various kinds of noise, such as thermal noise, dark noise and amplifier noise
%\footnote{Hans, p.185}
\cite{hans2004}.
In the following sections, we will focus on two noise sources, quantum noise and thermal noise.
%
%
%
\subsubsection{Quantum Noise}
In order to grasp this effect, the quantum mechanical description of balanced homodyne detection will be used, employing quantum operators to describe the effect of each component in the system (fig. \ref{fig:scheme_homodyne}). We start with the operators $\hat{a}_S$ and $\hat{a}_{LO}$ corresponding to the annihilation operator for the signal and local oscillator, which are the inputs in a beam divisor. The outputs will be $\hat{a}_3$ and $\hat{a}_4$.
Using a balanced beam splitter, we can write the output as
%
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{48mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\hat{a}_3 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \hat{a}_S + \hat{a}_{LO} \right)
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
	$,\quad$
	\begin{minipage}{48mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\hat{a}_4 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \hat{a}_S - \hat{a}_{LO} \right)
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%
The final output of a homodyne measurement will be proportional to the difference between the photocurrents in arm $3$ and $4$. Then
%
\begin{equation}
I_{34} = I_3 - I_4 \sim \braket{\hat{n}_3 - \hat{n}_4}
\end{equation}
%
We can define an operator that describes the difference of number of photons in arm 3 and arm 4:
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{m} = \hat{a}^\dagger_3\hat{a}_3 - \hat{a}^\dagger_4\hat{a}_4
\end{equation}
%
If we assume that the local oscillator produces the the coherent state $\ket{\beta}$, then the expected value of this measurement will be
%
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{58mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\braket{m} = 2|\alpha||\beta|\cos({\theta_\alpha - \theta_\beta})
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
	$,\quad$
	\begin{minipage}{46mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\textrm{Var}(m) = |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%
The local oscillator normally has a greater power than the signal
%VER REFERENCIAS
, then $|\alpha| \ll |\beta|$. If we use as unit, $2|\beta|$, then these two quantities can be simplified to
%
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{52mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\braket{m} = |\alpha|\cos({\theta_\alpha - \theta_\beta})
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
	$,\quad$
	\begin{minipage}{34mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\textrm{Var}(m) \approx \frac{1}{4}
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%
\cite{hans2004}
%\footnote{Referencia indirecta: Livro: Hans, p.207}
\\
Has we have seen previously, in order to measure two quadratures simultaneously, we can use double balanced homodyne detection. For each quadrature, the input signal now has half the power, so $|\alpha| \rightarrow |\alpha/\sqrt{2}|$.  If we use a local oscillator that produces states $\ket{\beta}$, then we can divide it in two beams in state $\ket{\beta/\sqrt{2}}$ and $\ket{i\beta/\sqrt{2}}$ which will be used in each homodyne detection. In this setting, the expected values for each quadrature, $X$ and $Y$, (in normalized values of $\sqrt{2}|\beta|$) are
%
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{58mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\braket{m_X} = \left|\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\right| \cos({\theta_\alpha - \theta_\beta})
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
	$,\quad$
	\begin{minipage}{37mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\textrm{Var}(m_X) \approx \frac{1}{4}
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%
%
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{58mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\braket{m_Y} =  \left|\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\right| \sin({\theta_\alpha - \theta_\beta})
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
	$,\quad$
	\begin{minipage}{37mm}
		\noindent
		\begin{equation}
			\textrm{Var}(m_Y) \approx \frac{1}{4}
		\end{equation}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%
Therefore the measurement of each quadrature will have half the amplitude, but the same variance.
%
%
%
\subsubsection{Thermal noise}
Thermal noise is generated by electrons in response to temperature. It's contribution to the resulting current can be described by the following equation
\cite{fox2006}
%\footnote{Mark Fox, p. 96}
%
\begin{equation}
\braket{(\Delta i_T)^2} = 4 K_B T_0 B/R_L
\end{equation}
%
in which $K_B$ it's Boltzmann's constant, $T_0$ is the absolute temperature, $B$ is the bandwidth and $R_L$ is the receiver load impedance. The $B$ value is imposed by default or chosen when the measurements are made, but the $R_L$ value is dependent in the internal setup of the various components of the detection system. Nevertheless, for simulation purposes, we can just introduce an experimental value.\\

The simulation setup is represented in figure \ref{fig:setup}. The starting point is the MQAM, which generates random states from the constelation given by the variable \texttt{iqAmplitudeValues}. The output from the generator is received in the Optical Hybrid where it is mixed with a local oscillator, outputing two optical signal pairs. Each pair is converted to currents by two photodiodes, and the same currents are subtracted from each other, originating another current proportional to one of the quadratures of the input state.
The other pair suffers the same process, but the resulting subtraction current will be proportional to another quadrature, dephased by $\pi/2$ relative to the other quadrature.\\

\subsection*{Simulation Results}\label{subsec:SHresults}

To test the simulated implementation, a series of states $\{\ket{\phi_i}\}$ were generated and detected, resulting in a series of measurements $\{(x_i,y_i)\}$. The simulation result is presented in figure $\ref{fig:constelation}$:
%
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{./sdf/quantum_noise/figures/constelation1.png}
\caption{Simulation of a constelation of 4 states (n = 100)}
\label{fig:constelation}
\end{figure}
%
We see that the measurements made groups in certain regions. Each of this groups is centered in the expected value $(\braket{\textrm{X}}, \braket{\textrm{Y}})$ of one the generated states. Also, they show some variance, which was tested for various expected number of photons, $\braket{n}$, resulting in figure \ref{fig:variance}:
%
\begin{figure}[H]
\captionsetup{justification=centering}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{./sdf/quantum_noise/figures/plot_var_vs_n1.png}
\caption{Simulation of the variance of $m$.\\Local oscillator expected number of photons: $10^4$}
\label{fig:variance}
\end{figure}
%
It was expected that the variance should independent of the input's signal number of photons. Plot \ref{fig:variance} shows that for low values of $n_S$, the simulation is in accordance with the theoretical prevision, with $\textrm{Var(X)} = \textrm{Var(Y)} = \frac{1}{4}$ . For large values of $n_S$, when the number of photons is about the same has the local oscillator, the quantum noise variance starts to grow proportionally to $n_S$, in accordance with the non approximated calculation of quantum noise (eq. \ref{eq:noise}).\\
\\
{\bf Noise Variance with LO power Simulation}\\
The following plot shows the behavior of current noise variance $\braket{(\Delta i)^2}$ with local oscilator power, $P_{LO}$:
%
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{./sdf/quantum_noise/figures/power_plot.png}
	\caption{Output current variance in function of LO power.}
	\label{fig:variance_lo_power}
\end{figure}
%
%
We see that for low LO power, the dominant noise is the thermal contribution, but for higher power, quantum noise dominates, growing proportionally to $P_{LO}$. This in accordance with equation \ref{eq:approx_noise}\\
\\

\subsection{Experimental setup}
%
To confirm the theoretical results obtained in section \ref{subsec:intro}, two experimental setups will be created.\\
In the first experiement, we will study quantum noise in the single homodyne detection. The experimental setup will be based on the paper \ref{chi2011balanced}.\\
In the second experiment, we will study quantum noise in the double homodyne detection setup, which will be basically an extension of the single homodyne detection setup.\\
\\
\subsubsection{Single homodyne detection}
%
To keep the experiment simple and avoid extra sources of noise, we will avoid using black boxes wich have complicated inner workings, having a preference in using simple components, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:experimental_homodyne_setup}:
\\

A single laser is splitted and used as the source for the signal (S) and the local oscillator (LO). The signal beam is pulsed and highly attenuated. The local oscillator is also attenuaded, but not pulsed. The signal and local oscillator interfere in a Beam Splitter originating two beams which are then converted to voltages in the PIN. These voltages are read in the Digital Oscilator (OSC) and collect in the computer. In the post processing phase, the quantum noise is measured by applying a difference between the two beams and measuring it's variance.
\\
The second stage of the experiment will be very similar to the first one, in which the signal and local oscillator branches will be divided. One of the new branches of the local oscilator will suffer a phase delay of $\pi/2$, in order to measure the quadrature component of the incoming signal.\\
%
%
\subsubsection{Data analysis}
%
Using the data collected in the Digital Oscilloscope, we process each sample for each power level (which???).
This data analysis will consist in the following steps:
1) Subtract the data coming from MONITOR- from the data from MONITOR+.\\
2) Calculate the average impulse and the variance of the impulse. (VALE A PENA ESPECIFICAR A EQUIVALÊNCIA DE FASE?)\\
3) The representative variance will be the variance of the pulse maximum.\\\
%
For each combination of the expected number of photons present in the signal and the local oscillator, we will obtain the variance in the plateau of the pulse. The final variance is simply the mean of the variances of all pulses.
%

\subsubsection{Double homodyne detection}
%
-- UNDER CONSTRUCTION --\\
\\
The experiemental setup for this experiment is a simple extension of the single homodyne detection. To implement this experiment, the signal beam will be divided in two beams, in which one of them will be detect in phase with local oscillator and the other in phase with a an oscillator with a $pi/2$ phase relative to the first one.????

    \end{subfigure}
    \captionsetup{justification=centering}
    \caption{Noise variance dependency with local oscilator power for two different quadratures. Experimental vs fitted data.}
\end{figure}
%
Figures $\ref{fig:noise-exp-1}$ and $\ref{fig:noise-exp-3}$ show measurements of total noise for two different quadratures. For low power of LO, the noise variance flutuates around a constant value. For high power of LO, $(P_{LO}>10^{-4}W)$, the variance of noise shows an increasing trend roughly proportional to $P_{LO}^2$. The polynomial fittings confirm this trend, showing a degree 2 coefficient much larger than the degree 1 coefficient
%
\begin{equation}
\textrm{Var}_X = 2.22 \!\! \times \!\! 10^{-5} + 9.6 \!\! \times \!\! 10^{-3} P_{LO} + 3.40 P_{LO}^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\textrm{Var}_Y = 2.71 \!\! \times \!\! 10^{-5} + 8.9 \!\! \times \!\! 10^{-3} P_{LO} + 7.25 P_{LO}^2
\end{equation}
%
The expected growth should be proportional to $P_{LO}$, but the RIN noise, originated by the electric apparatus, which grows quadratically with the power, is dominating the noise amplitude for large $P_{LO}$.\\
We see that both the simulation and experimental data display a similar behaviour, but the quadratic growth of noise for large $P_{LO}$ was not predicted in the simulations.\\
