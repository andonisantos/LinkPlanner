Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) is the simplest form of Phase Shift Keying (PSK), in which binary information is encoded into a two state constellation with the states being separated by a phase shift of $\pi$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:BPSKConst}).

White noise is a random signal with equal intensity at all frequencies, having a constant power spectral density. White noise is said to be Gaussian (WGN) if its samples follow a normal distribution with zero mean and a certain variance $\sigma^2$. For WGN we know that its spectral density equals its variance. For the purpose of this work, additive WGN is used to model thermal noise typically observed in coherent receivers.
\par
The purpose of this system is to simulate BPSK transmission in back-to-back configuration with additive WGN at the receiver and to perform an accurate estimation of the BER and validate the estimation using theoretical values.

\subsection{Theoretical Analysis}

The output of the system with added gaussian noise follows a normal distribution, whose first probabilistic moment can be readily obtained by knowledge of the optical power of the received signal and local oscillator,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mu1}
m_i=2\sqrt{P_LP_S}G_{ele}\cos(\Delta\theta_i),
\end{equation}
where $P_L$ and $P_S$ are the optical powers, in watts, of the local oscillator and signal, respectively, $G_{ele}$ is the gain of the transimpedance amplifier the coherent receiver and $\Delta\theta_i$ is the phase difference between the local oscillator and the signal, for BPSK this takes the values $\pi$ and 0, in which case~\eqref{eq:mu1} can be reduced to,
\begin{equation}
m_i=(-1)^{i+1}2\sqrt{P_LP_S}G_{ele},~i=0,~1.
\end{equation}
The second moment is directly chosen by inputting the spectral density of the noise $\sigma^2$, and thus is known \textit{a priori}.
\par
Both probabilist moments being known, the probability distribution of measurement results is given by a simple normal distribution,
\begin{equation}
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(x-m_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}}.
\end{equation}
The BER is calculated in the following manner,
\begin{equation}
BER=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{+\infty}f(x|\Delta\theta=\pi)\text{d}x+\frac{1}{2}\int^0_{-\infty}f(x|\Delta\theta=0)\text{d}x,
\end{equation}
given the symmetry of the system, this can be simplified to,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BERtheoretical}
BER=\int_0^{+\infty}f(x|\Delta\theta=\pi)\text{d}x=\frac{1}{2}\text{erfc}\left(\frac{-m_0}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Simulation Analysis}

A diagram of the system being simulated is presented in the Figure~\ref{fig:homodynesystem}. A random binary sequence is generated and encoded in an optical signal using BPSK modulation. The decoding of the optical signal is accomplished by an homodyne receiver, which combines the signal with a local oscillator. The received binary signal is compared with the transmitted binary signal in order to estimate the Bit Error Rate (BER). The simulation is repeated for multiple signal power levels, each corresponding BER is recorded and plotted against the expectation value.

The simulation results are presented in orange with the computed lower and upper bounds, while the expected value, obtained from~\eqref{eq:BERtheoretical}, is presented as a full blue line.
