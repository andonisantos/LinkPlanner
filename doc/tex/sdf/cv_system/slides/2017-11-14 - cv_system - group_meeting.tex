\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}[t]{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Study CV-QKD with 4 state discrete modulation.
\item Both simulation and experimental results where obtained.
\item Results where linked to theoretical expected values, not each other (missing detector information to compare simulation to experimental values).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Results in this Presentation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulation results:
\begin{itemize}
\item Noise characterization.
\item Secret key generation rate in function of transmission for two levels of excess noise.
\end{itemize}
\item Experimental results:
\begin{itemize}
\item Phase drift compensation.
\item Noise characterization experiment.
\item Key distribution experiment with secret key generation rate estimation.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
